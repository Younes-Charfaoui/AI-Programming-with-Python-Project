# AI Programming with Python Project ✅

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. 

The aim of this project is to develop an image classifier built with PyTorch using Pretrained CNN'S, then convert it into a command-line application.

I used the DenseNet161 which results in a good performance, and in the Command line, I used also AlexNet and Resnet.
